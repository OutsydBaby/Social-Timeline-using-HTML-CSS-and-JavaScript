# SocialTimeline

The "SocialTimeline" project enhances how users engage with a dynamic content feed using special functions built with JavaScript. This program allows users to interact with posts by liking them, leaving comments, and sharing content. Each section in the timeline includes buttons that increase counts for likes, comments, and shares, making it more interactive and engaging for everyone.

## Key Features

- **Like Button**: Increases the number of likes when clicked.
- **Comment Button**: Shows or hides a box where you can write a comment.
- **Comment Submission**: Adds your comment to the post and clears the comment box after you submit.
- **Share Button**: Increases the number of shares when clicked.

## How It Works

The program responds to actions from users interacting with the timeline. When you click a button, like the "Like" or "Comment" button, it updates the numbers you see on the screen. This makes it easy and fun to use the timeline and participate in the community.
